Building a serverless APK:
-- https://stackoverflow.com/posts/46170797/revisions

Following Aditya Singh's answer the generated (unsigned) apk would not install on my phone. I had to generated a signed apk using the instructions here.

The following worked for me:

$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
Place the my-release-key.keystore file under the android/app directory in your project folder. Then edit the file  ~/.gradle/gradle.properties and add the following (replace **** with the correct keystore password, alias and key password)

MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=my-release-key.keystore
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=****
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=****
If you're using MacOS, you can store your password in the keychain using the instructions here instead of storing it in plaintext.

Then edit app/build.gradle and ensure the following are there (the sections with signingConfigs signingConfig may need to be added) :

...
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig { ... }
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            if (project.hasProperty('MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE')) {
                storeFile file(MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE)
                storePassword MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
                keyAlias MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
                keyPassword MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
            }
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            ...
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}
...
Then run the command cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease and find your signed apk under android/app/build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk
